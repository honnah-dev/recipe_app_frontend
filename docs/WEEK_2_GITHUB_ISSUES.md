# Tips for Week 2

**Frontend moves fast!** You'll see visual progress every day which is motivating.

**Reuse components:** RecipeCard, modals, buttons - build once, use everywhere.

**Test in browser constantly:** Don't wait until Day 16 to open the app!

**Keep CSS organized:** Create separate CSS files for components or use a single styles file with clear sections.

**Reference NYT Cooking:** Keep https://cooking.nytimes.com open for design inspiration.
